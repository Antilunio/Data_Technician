------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Product Strategist with 25 years navigating the intersection of science and business. I help early-stage biotech companies make smarter product decisions through fractional leadership and proprietary competitive intelligence. Former roles at Oxford University, Revvity, Bio-Rad, and Bio-Techne. Now building Bioicus Lab to solve the "Idle Valley Problem" - where promising spinouts waste capital on premature full-time hires during long R&D cycles
